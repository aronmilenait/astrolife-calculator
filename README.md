## FAQ
### Why did you choose the Drake Equation?
I was trying to create an app that calculated the possibilities of finding life all over the galaxy. My main idea was to create some sort of algorithm that calculated, considering the discovered universe, how many chances we had of finding something like life on Earth in it's whole.

While researching options to perform this, I came across this equation. I'm not the best at maths, although I consider them cool, but after checking that out I decided to use that way to calculate the possibilities. 

If you want to get to know more about it, I will recommend the following resources:
